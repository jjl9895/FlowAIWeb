                        There's no "ImageNet for workflows" - the missing backbone that agentic AI desperately needs. 
                        Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have identified workflow data as a huge bottleneck. 
                        We're building the solution.

                <h2>How Flow AI Works</h2>
                <div class="info-content">
                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            Flow AI is an application and a browser extension that tracks data and packages it in a way that makes it optimal for training agentic AI. This desktop application and browser would record how users interact with software and their computers. Clicks, form submissions, navigations, shortcuts, cross-app workflows, etc. are tracked. This application would be easily customizable and would only track applications that a user allows to be tracked. Users of Flow AI would also be paid for letting the application use their workflow data. With just the click of a button, a user can start and stop tracking.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            On the backend, we would turn raw interactions such as clicks, form submissions, app navigation, etc. into a proper schema. This would also include outcome signals (success, failure, abandonment), and we would then combine them into higher-level task graphs. Furthermore, with all this data, we can even have a feature that provides context for LLMs as a free addition to incentivize users. Existing solutions, like rewind.ai, already offer similar tracking services but require payment from the tracked individuals.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The result of Flow AI tracking and paying users would be a structured and large-scale dataset of real human computer usage that companies can use to evaluate and train agentic AI systems. Just as how Common Crawl became indispensable to LLM training, Flow AI could be the workflow data backbone for agentic labs and enterprises. Even if APIs can be used for clicking certain buttons or pressing keys, the training data still needs the context we provide. Furthermore, cross-app navigation and workflows would still be extremely important, but only keys and clicks would be less valued. Our data would provide this crucial missing context.
